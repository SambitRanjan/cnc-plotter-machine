CNC Machines are Computerized Numerical Control Machines which are used to draw anything or design any mechanical part according to the design program fed into their controller unit. Controller unit can be either computer or microcontroller. CNC machines have stepper and servo motors to draw the design as per the fed program. Here  I decided to make a simple CNC Plotter Machine based on Arduino which is by far the simplest to make. You can also use this as an Arduino CNC drawing machine with little modifications. 
This DIY Arduino CNC Machine can draw most of the basic shapes, texts and even cartoons. It's operation is similar to the way a human hand writes. Itâ€™s faster and more accurate compared to the way a human being can write or draw.
